I need to go to the#staffroom!
Should I go home for today?
School isn't over yet!
The fire bell is ringing!#All the students and#teachers have gone outside!
I should pull the heist#during the school day...
Yes!! I found the exam#questions! But the teachers#are back... I need to get#out of here!
There's no time to look#around, I need to get out of#here!
Today is my first day at#Brooklands Academy... I#hope it will be okay...
The teachers caught me in#the act! I'm suspended from#after school activities and#will get a capped exam mark.
The heist was a success! I#will leak the questions to#my friends.
I need to look for the exam#questions!
