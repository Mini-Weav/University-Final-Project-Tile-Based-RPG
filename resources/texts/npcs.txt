If you want to attend a #class, just talk to the #teacher!
You can check your grades #or friends by pressing the #'E' or 'F' keys.
That red-haired guy seems #to have an endless supply #of energy drinks. I wonder #where he got them.
I'm practising food tech #so I can give food to #Emily!
Believe it or not, Natahn #is really good at DT. He #is crazy about crafts!

If you are lost, press 'M' #to open your map!
I sometimes hear weird #sounds coming from the #chemistry lab after school.
You should eat lunch so #you are refreshed for the #next class! Sometimes #the food is bad though...
I think people on sports #teams are really cool! #You need to raise your PE #grade to join though!
I always see Frankie in #the computer lab after #school. She tries so hard #but still gets poor grades!
---------------------------------
It isn't lunch time yet! #Get to class!
You've already eaten #today. No seconds!
Sorry kid, the canteen's #shut.
